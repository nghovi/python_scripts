summarize:
- statement grouping is done by indentation
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary, no $,@,my,var,int, ...
- python, cmd z (mac), ctrl z (window)
- indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements, no comma, no parathesis
- a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs.
- call python function by keyword arguments. Like perl with a hash argument. default argument like php, tuples args with *arg, dictionary arg with **dict
